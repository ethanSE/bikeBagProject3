## Description

As a cycling enthusiast and bike commuter I have been interested in custom bike frame bags for a while and have sewn several of my own design. Bike frame bags are a great technology and increasing accessibility by reducing cost could help to encourage more people to commute by bike and increase quality of life for existing bike commuters.

Custom bike frame bags are currently expensive. A lot of this is labor cost. Materials are only around $50 per bag when using good quality waterproof fabric and zippers and making a full frame bag with two pockets.

Increase automation in design, cutting stock optimization, and cutting could reduce production costs and increase accessibility.

In its current state this project:  
  - demonstrates what the front end of such an application could look like  
  - provides a directed user experience from account creation to design finalization  
  - stores photo and dimensions in AWS backend
  
Goals for this project include:   
  - build out better display of user's saved designs
  - refactor with typescript
  - rebuild HTML5 canvas interaction for a better UX 
    - users should be able to drag points
    - real-time feedback about validity (shape must be closed, not self-intersecting)
  - incorporate seam allowance calculations in output displayed to user for demonstration purposes
  - allow user to download SVG file
